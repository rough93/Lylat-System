	{
		Aquas = A blue marble hanging in space, this body appears to be covered completely by water. After these characteristics, it will be named Aquas.
		Corneria = In the midst of several other bodies, a large exoplanet can be made out in transit of its parent star. The highest bidder elected to call it Corneria, how corny.
		Eladard = Only the most advanced of our sensors was able to spot a planet so close to its parent star, our scientists hope to study the planet further to discover what type of planet could exist so close to a sun. It shall be called...Eladard.
		Fichina = A scarred planet was seen on the outer edge of the new solar system. At the same time, a new SRB was created that made the sound FCHHHHNA, and thus Fichina was named.
		Fortuna = After cleaning our telescopes, we realized that the spot on the scope wasnt actually dirt, we named the new planet Fortuna.
		Katina = A new body was discovered in transit of its star, it appears to be near the center of the orbits of other planets, it will be named Katina, after the Head of VAB operations, Katina Kerman.
		Macbeth = To name it, or not to name it, that is the question. We decided that we would in fact name, and in tribute to the great playright William Shakerman, it will be named Macbeth. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
		Sauria = We appear to have discovered two planets on the same orbit, we will name the new planet Sauria, the sister planet.
		Titania = A huge planet was spotted over its transit, its size reminds us of the Gods of old and the massive Titans who fought them, and so we will call it Titania.
		Venom = Another planet was spotted in orbit of Solar, we're beggining to think that conditions there must be toxic to all life, we will call this planet Venom.
		Zoness = A greenish planet was just spotted by our telescopes, it seems to be in the middle of the zone for life around a sun, we will therefore call it Zoness.
